Resource: [DEFINITION OF DATA IN TRANSIT VS. DATA AT REST](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/data-protection-data-in-transit-vs-data-at-rest)

## Definition of Data in Transit vs Data at Rest
- Data in transit or data in motion - data actively moving from one location to another.
- Data at rest - data not actively moving such as data stored on a drive.

## Role of Encryption in Data Protection in Transit and at Rest
- there are multiple approach into protecting data, encryption plays a major role and is a popular tool for securing data both in transit and at rest.
    - for data in transit:
        - encrypt sensitive data prior to moving 
        - use encrypted connections to protect while in transit = HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS
    - for data at rest:
        - encrypt sensitive files prior to storing
        - choose to encrypt the storage drive itself

## Best Practices for Data Protection
- most effective data protection methods is Encryption
- implement robust network security like firewalls and NAC against malware attacks and intrusions
- use proactive security measures that identify at-risk data 
- protection solutions with policies that enable user prompting, blocking, or automatic encryption
- create policies to systematically categorizing and classifying all company data
- for public, private or hybrid cloud provider - evaluate cloud vendors security measures
- a proactive approach: classifying and categorizing data coupled with content, user and context-aware security protocol is the safest and most effective.
