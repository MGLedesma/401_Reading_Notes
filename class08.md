Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorizzed users. 
- DLP software: classifies regulated, confidential and business critical data and identifies violations of policies defined by organizations or within a predefined policy pack, typically driven by regulatory compliance such as HiPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR.
- DLP enforces: remediation with alerts, encryption, and other protective actions to prevent end users from accidentally or maliciously sharing data that could put the organization at risk. 
- DLP monitor and control: endpoint activities, filter data streams on corporate networks, and monitor data in the cloud to protect data at rest, in motion and in use.
- DLP provides: reporting to meet compliance and auditing requirements and identify areas of weakness and anomalies for forensics and indident responses.

## 3 Main Causes for DLP
1. Personal Information Protection / Compliance
    - DLP can identify, classify, and tag sensitive data and monitor activities and events surrounding that data
2. Intellectual Property Protection
    - DLP can classify intellectual property in both structured and unstructured forms with policies and controls in place to protect against unwanted exfiltration of data.
3. Data Visibility
    - DLP can help see and track data at endpoints, networks, and the cloud, to provide with visibility into how individual users within organization interact with data.
