# CIS Benchmarks

Resource: [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cis-benchmarks)

### What is CIS Benchmarks?
- published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), are documented industry best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, and networks.

### How are CIS Benchmarks organized?
- includes multiple configuration recommendations based on one of two profile levels. 
    - Level 1 benchmark = base-level configurations that are easier to implement and have minimal impact on business functionality. 
    - Level 2 benchmark = intended for high-security environments and require more coordination and planning to implement with minimal business disruption.

- 7 core categories of CIS Benchmarks
    - Operating systems benchmarks - security configurations of core OS, best practice guidelines for access restriction, user profiles, driver installation protocols and internet browser configurations.
    - Server software benchmarks - security configurations of widely used server software, benchmarks include recommendations for configuring Kubernetes PKI certificates, API server settings, server admin controls, vNetwork policies, and storage restrictions.
    - Cloud provider benchmarks - security configurtions for public clouds, include guidelines for configuring identity and access management (IAM), system logging protocols, network configurations, and regulatory compliance safeguards. 
    - Mobile device benchmarks - address mobile operating systems, focus on areas such as developer options and settings, OS privacy configurations, browser settings, and app permissions.
    - Network device benchmarks - general and vendor-specific security configuration guidelines for network devices and applicable hardware.
    - Desktop software benchmarks - focus on email privacy and server settings, mobile device management, default browser settings, and third-party software blocking
    - Multi-function print device benchmarks - outline security best practices for configuring multi-function printers in office settings and cover such topics as firmware updating, TCP/IP configurations, wireless access configuration, user management, and file sharing.
  
### CIS Hardened Images 
- are pre-configured, more secure than standard virtual images, and significantly limit the security vulnerabilities that can lead to a cyberattack. 

### CIS Benchmarks and regulatory compliance
- allign with security and data privacy regulatory frameworks including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the PCI DSS, HIPAA and ISO/EIC 2700.
