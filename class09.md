# Public Key Infrastructure

Resource: [What is PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)?](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pki)

- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world. The basic idea is to have one or more trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device. The key can then be used as an identity for the user in digital networks.

- The purpose of a PKI is to securely associate a key with an entity.
    - Entity = user and devices that have keys
    - Certificate Authority (CA) = a trusted party signing the document associating the key with the device and also has a cryptographic key that is uses for signing these documents. 
    - Certificates = are documents being signed with the crptographic keys

- PKI relies on digital signature technology which uses public key cryptography. The keys is called the private key and public key.
